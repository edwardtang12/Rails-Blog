2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
3. No animal shall wear clothes.
4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.

The best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. The effect of drinking one is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.
It was invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox.", user: ford, category: galaxy_guide)
